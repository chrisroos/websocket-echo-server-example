## Intro

This is a version of the echo server [introduced in Pratik's blog post](http://m.onkey.org/websockets-made-easy-with-cramp) that's been changed to use the current version of Cramp ([ref a311066d747fc6ad9f2c](https://github.com/lifo/cramp/commit/a311066d747fc6ad9f2cd356b3e501c4e6d91bee)).

I used it to diagnose some websocket oddness we're seeing in an internal chat app.
